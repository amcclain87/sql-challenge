# sql-challenge

I started off this challenge by exploring the data using Excel to visualize see how the data was laid out and how they were connected. I started the work before we went over foreign keys in class, so made multiple errors before learning tables needed to created in a certain sequence starting with the titles table for employee focused data, and departments for the department focused data. Learning how these foreign keys interacted with the other tables to act as a data validator made the ERD make much more sense to me later on.

The mod_9_tables have the tables created in a sequential order to make sure the forgeign keys lined up. 

mod_9_querries contain all the assigned querries in the assignment.

module 9 ERD.png contains the ERD for the tables.
